Undergraduate 4th year course implementation of a preliminary soil classification project using ML (Back before AI/ML was a thing outside of research circles). 

The focus of the project was a theoretical report, (link below). However, I wanted to try and quickly implement a demo application for testing purposes, the code of which is here.

The theory and report can be found here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363017683_A_Hoeffding_Decision_Tree_Based_Approach_for_Soil_Classification
